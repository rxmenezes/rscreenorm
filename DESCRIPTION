Description: Normalizes data from multiple genetic screens, such 
    as for example siRNA screens or CRISPR-Cas9 screens, possibly corresponding
    to different cell lines. Using an invariant set of values for each 
    replicate, it quantile-normalizes all replicates while preserving 
    differences in phenotype between them. Raw data can be read in as 
    tab-delimited files, and must include gene and feature annotation, in 
    particular indicating which features are part of the library and which ones 
    are negative/positive controls.
